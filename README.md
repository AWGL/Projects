# Projects
Ideas for projects

* Assess potential of and test DeepVariant for variant calling

* HAIL: distributed analysis / management of VCF files using SPARK

* Update schedule for locally downloaded databases and software

* Ideas for reducing burden of log file checking

* Code review plugin in github (Erik?)

* Dealing with the data fragmentation we have (see how new LIMS helps first?)

* Develop easy test cases to run for pipeline and software revalidation (will enable us to be more agile and update software more regularly

* Process control QC for the sequencers (tracking some of the additional metrics suggested by Illumina as part of the QC database project?)

* Track the expected sensitivity of the control sample on TSO for a while to come up with a better threshold for indicating run processing failure
